## Purpose 
Comparing the functionality and difference between the apis provided by the popular trading exchange.
Combining those to form a system that could effectively retrieve market information from all of the working apis. 

## functionality 
Proposed accepted API:

* futu                   (pretty comprehensive api but without US market information)
* td-ameritrade          (the documentation is not very well-written)
* alpaca                 (simple)
