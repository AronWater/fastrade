- Combining those to form a system that could effectively retrieve market information from all of the working apis. 

## functionality 
Proposed accepted API:


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [yahoo-finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/API,Documentation/view/v1)   |    You should know already |
| [Interactive Broker](http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/)  |   The REST API needs a pro subscription|
| [alpha vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)    |      providing free but limited usage per day|
| [futu](https://futunnopen.github.io/futu-api-doc/intro/intro.html)     |         pretty comprehensive api but without US market information|
|[td-ameritrade](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis)    | the documentation is not very well-written|
